        "Change is unavoidable, and often unforeseeable. Still, an organization can take steps to anticipate and adapt to sudden shifts, whether to take advantage of a new opportunity or to better insulate from unexpected adversity. In addition to long-term planning, a business must constantly reposition itself to ensure its success and survival as it navigates the twists, kinks, and ripples of the dynamic global fabric. The solution is a long-term adaptive strategy that incorporates short-term agility - predicting the twists and turns, keeping a steady balance, and staying well positioned throughout for whatever the next bend may bring.",
        "Our strategy for business continuity starts with evaluating and understanding current and upcoming research, media, platforms, and agile strategies. The emphasis of the information technology and information systems in an adaptive enterprise is placed on flexible enterprise architecture to support long-term adaptability. Such architectures are future-proofed to remain suitable for your business needs, even through disruptions in the industry, geopolitical trends, and supersession of existing technologies.",
        "Adaptive organizations incorporate customer intelligence to give their decision makers easy access to the key insights of their customer base. They engage business intelligence tools to aid in strategy building, ensure load-responsive supply chains, integrate business processes, eliminate redundant resources, and foster rapid innovation.",
        "Adaptive Enterprise Inc. can assist you with implementing these common patterns and principles for effective business management in any industry, anywhere."

        "Adaptive Systems are found around us, in biology as well as in many successful social structures. We perhaps owe our day-to-day function and our mental exploits to our adaptive nature and sub-systems. Each individual, family or social unit is indeed an adaptive enterprise. Businesses operate in a similar manner in the same unpredictable environment. ",
        "Since unpredictability and change are unavoidable consequences of doing business in an unpredictable, discontinuous business environment, the strategy that makes sense is to combat uncertainty on three key fronts - keep an eye on future research, technology and trends; instantaneously sense and respond to customer trends and feedback; and find ways to steer your core competence despite and in-concert with the changing landscape, embracing new opportunities along the way. ",
        "The first goal can be addressed by instilling a strong commitment to sensing, understanding and embracing upcoming research and trends. ",
        "The second goal will be achieved by planning to be adaptive i.e. streamlining your processes, flows and campaigns to handle almost-real-time channels. For example, by deploying an infrastructure that can easily accommodate (in a cost-effective manner) changes to business processes, by running a supply chain that will respond to supply/demand not only in real time and relatively instantaneous but also with some immunity (e.g. by virtue of global redundancy) to geo-political and economical conditions, by responding to customers' pulse in-tandem (actual feedback as well customer intelligence/personalization - big data, social media, dedicated clouds, loyalty factors), and judiciously pivoting on key value propositions e.g. in response to rolling out minimum viable products. ",
        "The third goal is accomplished by recognizing your core business values, strengths, people and processes, and leveraging as well as adapting these in the face of change, seeking a positive net gain as the response to disruption. ",
        "An adaptive enterprise supports an infrastructure that is able to sense change and respond quickly to market needs. An adaptive enterprise helps CIO's link business with IT. This enables them to make decisions quickly to stay ahead of their competitors. This increases the company's profitability."

        "Almost every industry presents its challenges and opportunities in the 'Adaptive' landscape. They can arrive in the form of new research (internal or external), technology shifts, customer trends, geopolitical or environmental concerns, service description or scope change, supply-chain continuity, and of course, economics.",
        "Many of these challenges are unique to specific industries and may not be addressed by one-size-fits-all type of solutions. Others, though, could be looked at in terms of boilerplate patterns, trends, technologies, solutions and even entire business functions. These could be indicative of more pervasive landscape shifts, and can, hence, be shared and leveraged as COT-like pieces. Some significant trends that are normally common across the board, throughout the industry landscape, are employment of adaptive strategies, flexible enterprise architectures, streamlined processes, and well-defined intellectual capital that is understood as well as malleable under change. Adaptability for an industry is its constituent's ability to reach customers and collect their feedback, to incrementally roll out 'minimal viable products' ahead of more complete solutions based on resulting feedback, and to be lean and agile i.e. work with smaller investments in infrastructure compared to long worn out cycles where results could be obsolete by the time they can be rolled out. ",
        "Another blend of challenges is presented as new research. For example, whereas nanotechnology can bring a disruptive opportunity for an industry to produce lighter cars and structures, it also has the potential of changing its IT landscape through a continuation of Moore's law by leveraging carbon nano-structures in computing and communication platforms. Our changing environment is yet another disruptor. Examples include adoption of clean energy and fuel-efficient cars. The full list include, the shifting computing technologies (e.g. cloud computing, SaaS and big data), resurgence of expert systems fuelled by cheap computing power (e.g. computing developments that could transform lawyers' and doctors' work by embedding them with the functions of healthcare and legal services expert systems), evolving consumer trends (e.g. online and mobile customers, and social media), and more. ",
        "Among the many trends to watch include: software as a service, cloud computing, social media, 'e-bots' - robotics and expert systems, e-learning, brain imaging - and hence better models for human-computer interaction and intellectual capital, agile development, increased automation - software-heavy industrialization, big data, personalized marketing, content distribution and intellectual property rightsâ€¦ ",

        "The use of cloud computing is not only pervasive but has been around for some time depending on how you choose to define 'cloud'. Accounting, CRM, ERP, and so on, have been running in the cloud, and the flexible interpretation of this term has been used or misused to market virtually any application that is meaningful in today's connected world. That being said, the 'Cloud' and creative application of the associated service (SaaS) paradigm hold tremendous disruptive potential, going forward. Companies can be truly adaptive when they tap into the power, flexibility, connectivity, reliability, security, agility and savings associated with this 'new' way of running business and information technology. Despite the overwhelming buzz, and the significant maturation and adoption of this paradigm, Cloud's potential for driving business innovation still remains virtually untapped. ",

An adaptive enterprise client of ours not only strives to stay on top of current research in their industry but also struggles to keep up with the rapid pace of the information technology industry. Although it's not important to adopt the 'latest and the greatest' in all cases, it is indeed important to embrace and be able to absorb the resulting gradual as well as disruptive changes. ",
        "Rules of the game are changing with the accelerating pace of scientific and technological research and its subsequent adoption. For an enterprise to survive the resulting turbulence, its people, processes, services, business/customer intelligence and infrastructure need to be aligned (end-to-end). It is also required to be agile and adaptive, with a reasonably clear vision of what may or may not be coming down the pipe.

        "Analytics to incorporate student behaviour and feedback, technology to accommodate students and staff with special needs, and on-demand content delivery are some of the core initiatives that institutions and districts could deploy. Change is another key ingredient and a necessity; the coursework, course delivery strategies, and their associated information technology should be innately adaptive. ",
        "Some of the technology-assisted strengths and opportunities may include: online content delivery mode, \"gamification\" of education, dynamic coursework, tablets for books, collaboration tools, cost reductions, larger student base, intelligent-learning tools, up-to date and state of the art instruction, students prepared to meet the jobs of the decades ahead, teaching and coursework more in tune with social media habits of the current generation, additional revenue through the blending of various value-added education delivery services, and tiered certification of in-house MOOC-style learning. ",
        "The various challenges may include: resistance to change (from the existing investments in the existing infrastructure), keeping the brick-and-mortar education valuable, staying competitive and relevant, lack of time and resources to gainfully investigate new technologies, embracing IT-driven practices, MOOC-style learning through virtual and online classrooms, managing change, approving and rolling out the right blend of instruction, effective collaboration tools, video capture and streaming technologies, keeping students involved by meeting their enhanced multimedia expectations, and learner algorithms and analytics. ",
        "At the end, there is no silver bullet. They key to all this is to seek continuous feedback, be able to constantly change and pivot, and make the right investments in the right enabling technology. "

        "The next step in connectivity is a paradigm where computers, phones, embedded devices, cameras, sensors, meters, vehicles, utilities, infrastructure, the biosphere, people, and a whole lot will be somehow connected through some network. ",
        "Anything that can be connected, will be connected. There will be several reasons for doing so, both for consumers and for businesses. Business could gain advantage by providing new products and services, revamping their old services, generating and/or consuming more data, using analytics to direct marketing campaigns, collecting valuable business intelligence, increasing productivity of plants and offices, automatically reordering supplies, enhancing logistics and supply chains, and so forth. ",
        "At its most peripheral level, such connectivity is often termed as the Internet of Things (IoT). Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and sensor network technologies are two of its primary enablers. The result of such connectivity will produce huge amounts of (big) data, requiring the use of substantial storage technology innovations and expenditures. The network will also serve as the conduit for innovative services for people and businesses. The resulting data would require storage, monitoring, analytics and visualization. Cloud computing technology can provide the infrastructure for hosting services and processing data. The access to such data will be virtually ubiquitous. Security and privacy will remain important concerns. ",
        "In order to reap the benefit of this trend, and to thrive in it, businesses will need to take a look at their existing processes and identify areas for improvement. Networking \"things\" as part of the holistic infrastructure strategy fits well within the framework of adaptive IT architectures and methods. For example, agile methods and cloud-based infrastructure can help with iterative rollouts to meet the connectivity needs in an incremental fashion. From an alternate point of view, having access to useful data through the right connectivity also helps a business become more agile in its function. Examples include improved sensing and tracking of its manufacturing, shipments, customer feedback, and user habits. "

        "Software as a service (SaaS) is growing as a paradigm for delivering applications and services over Internet (cloud). This eliminates the hassle of installing and updating software components internally. The provider of the application manages the access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS is agile, as it reduces the time taken from the purchasing decision to the solution going live. In also ensures a high degree of adaptability in most cases as it allows for infrastructure cost saving (traded off for licensing fees), up-to-date hardware and software technology, rapid deployment, prototyping, quicker deployment cycles, and the flexibility of scaling. ",
        "There are, however, scenarios where corporations may require tighter ownership of their data and other intellectual assets. Latency (due to remote internet location) may also be less-than-optimal for applications requiring very quick turnaround, especially on a shop floor or in certain office intranet configurations. Loss of some control over real-time data may also be a concern in a minority of situations. It is, therefore, important to map out the exact needs, gaps and risks. The service provider's reputation and strengths, and the service level agreement are also important criteria to consider. ",
        "To the last point, with more and more vendors positioning their products as services, it becomes important to have a consolidated means of access all these services. SaaS Integration Platform (SIP) facilitates access to multiple services through a common, standard platform. Software as a service is evolving and expanding to incorporate more and more services to cater for increasing business functions and industry segments. Project management, office productivity, departmental software, analytics, collaboration, user verification, and electronic signatures are some of the many services that are now delivered through the cloud.

Each year about three million terabytes of data is created, and our data gathering continues to explode towards the zeta byte range. ",

        "Social media continues to move towards greater business integration. In a study by Booz Allen and Buddy Media, 38 percent of CEOs label social as a high priority, and 57 percent of companies plan to increase social media spending. ",
        "There is a lot that can be said, but here's the bottom line: does it help, or does it hurt? What functions of social integration are really important, and what are just nice to have? Is the time and effort working towards a solid relationship with customers, partners and public? Do the channels truly represent the organization's industry, customer demographics and geography? Will this generate useful analytics, help glean social business intelligence, and measure its customers' true pulse? In short, do you have a social media strategy, and do you have criteria, metrics and key performance indicators to measure if the social media message is relevant, if the time and effort are spent on the right goals, and if the campaigns are contributing towards building company's credibility? ",
        "An adaptive enterprise can build many such mechanisms into what could be called an adaptive approach to social media integration. The corporation can then use these built-in antennas to sense and tailor its message, optimize the message frequency, and prioritize the most suitable channels (from choices like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, YouTube, and any other suitable blogs). The company would then need to ensure that its campaigns are within its budget and the capabilities of its staff. They should also ensure that the platform itself and the quality of the content (form both sides) represent its corporate culture and identity. ",
        "It is also important to put a process (including a possible publish and approval process) around the social media efforts and adopt internal guidelines wherever practical. This will ensure efficiencies and message consistency. Automation of redundancies, and artificial intelligence and natural language processing may be considered in the near future, however not at the cost of audience's time and intelligence. \r\n"
