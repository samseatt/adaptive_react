        "text": "Change is unavoidable, and often unforeseeable. Still, an organization can take steps to anticipate and adapt to sudden shifts, whether to take advantage of a new opportunity or to better insulate from unexpected adversity. In addition to long-term planning, a business must constantly reposition itself to ensure its success and survival as it navigates the twists, kinks, and ripples of the dynamic global fabric. The solution is a long-term adaptive strategy that incorporates short-term agility - predicting the twists and turns, keeping a steady balance, and staying well positioned throughout for whatever the next bend may bring.\r\n \r\n Our strategy for business continuity starts with evaluating and understanding current and upcoming research, media, platforms, and agile strategies. The emphasis of the information technology and information systems in an adaptive enterprise is placed on flexible enterprise architecture to support long-term adaptability. Such architectures are future-proofed to remain suitable for your business needs, even through disruptions in the industry, geopolitical trends, and supersession of existing technologies. \r\n \r\n Adaptive organizations incorporate customer intelligence to give their decision makers easy access to the key insights of their customer base. They engage business intelligence tools to aid in strategy building, ensure load-responsive supply chains, integrate business processes, eliminate redundant resources, and foster rapid innovation. \r\n \r\n Adaptive Enterprise Inc. can assist you with implementing these common patterns and principles for effective business management in any industry, anywhere.",

        "text": "Adaptive Systems are found around us, in biology as well as in many successful social structures. We perhaps owe our day-to-day function and our mental exploits to our adaptive nature and sub-systems. Each individual, family or social unit is indeed an adaptive enterprise. Businesses operate in a similar manner in the same unpredictable environment. \r\n\r\nSince unpredictability and change are unavoidable consequences of doing business in an unpredictable, discontinuous business environment, the strategy that makes sense is to combat uncertainty on three key fronts - keep an eye on future research, technology and trends; instantaneously sense and respond to customer trends and feedback; and find ways to steer your core competence despite and in-concert with the changing landscape, embracing new opportunities along the way. \r\n\r\nThe first goal can be addressed by instilling a strong commitment to sensing, understanding and embracing upcoming research and trends. \r\n\r\nThe second goal will be achieved by planning to be adaptive i.e. streamlining your processes, flows and campaigns to handle almost-real-time channels. For example, by deploying an infrastructure that can easily accommodate (in a cost-effective manner) changes to business processes, by running a supply chain that will respond to supply\/demand not only in real time and relatively instantaneous but also with some immunity (e.g. by virtue of global redundancy) to geo-political and economical conditions, by responding to customers' pulse in-tandem (actual feedback as well customer intelligence\/personalization - big data, social media, dedicated clouds, loyalty factors), and judiciously pivoting on key value propositions e.g. in response to rolling out minimum viable products. \r\n\r\nThe third goal is accomplished by recognizing your core business values, strengths, people and processes, and leveraging as well as adapting these in the face of change, seeking a positive net gain as the response to disruption. \r\n\r\nAn adaptive enterprise supports an infrastructure that is able to sense change and respond quickly to market needs. An adaptive enterprise helps CIO's link business with IT. This enables them to make decisions quickly to stay ahead of their competitors. This increases the company's profitability.",

        "text": "Almost every industry presents its challenges and opportunities in the 'Adaptive' landscape. They can arrive in the form of new research (internal or external), technology shifts, customer trends, geopolitical or environmental concerns, service description or scope change, supply-chain continuity, and of course, economics. \r\n\r\nMany of these challenges are unique to specific industries and may not be addressed by one-size-fits-all type of solutions. Others, though, could be looked at in terms of boilerplate patterns, trends, technologies, solutions and even entire business functions. These could be indicative of more pervasive landscape shifts, and can, hence, be shared and leveraged as COT-like pieces. Some significant trends that are normally common across the board, throughout the industry landscape, are employment of adaptive strategies, flexible enterprise architectures, streamlined processes, and well-defined intellectual capital that is understood as well as malleable under change. Adaptability for an industry is its constituent's ability to reach customers and collect their feedback, to incrementally roll out 'minimal viable products' ahead of more complete solutions based on resulting feedback, and to be lean and agile i.e. work with smaller investments in infrastructure compared to long worn out cycles where results could be obsolete by the time they can be rolled out. \r\n\r\nAnother blend of challenges is presented as new research. For example, whereas nanotechnology can bring a disruptive opportunity for an industry to produce lighter cars and structures, it also has the potential of changing its IT landscape through a continuation of Moore's law by leveraging carbon nano-structures in computing and communication platforms. Our changing environment is yet another disruptor. Examples include adoption of clean energy and fuel-efficient cars. The full list include, the shifting computing technologies (e.g. cloud computing, SaaS and big data), resurgence of expert systems fuelled by cheap computing power (e.g. computing developments that could transform lawyers' and doctors' work by embedding them with the functions of healthcare and legal services expert systems), evolving consumer trends (e.g. online and mobile customers, and social media), and more. \r\n\r\nAmong the many trends to watch include: software as a service, cloud computing, social media, 'e-bots' - robotics and expert systems, e-learning, brain imaging - and hence better models for human-computer interaction and intellectual capital, agile development, increased automation - software-heavy industrialization, big data, personalized marketing, content distribution and intellectual property rights\u2026 \r\n\r\nWe have exposure to a number of these industries as well as to many of their common business, departmental, project, information technology, and subject matter requirements.",

Accounting, CRM, ERP, and so on, have been running in the cloud, and the flexible interpretation of this term has been used or misused to market virtually any application that is meaningful in today's connected world. That being said, the 'Cloud' and creative application of the associated service (SaaS) paradigm hold tremendous disruptive potential, going forward. Companies can be truly adaptive when they tap into the power, flexibility, connectivity, reliability, security, agility and savings associated with this 'new' way of running business and information technology. Despite the overwhelming buzz, and the significant maturation and adoption of this paradigm, Cloud's potential for driving business innovation still remains virtually untapped. \r\n\r\nJava has been around for some time and provides for a highly adopted, platform independent, open development environment with a strong dedicated community of developers. Unlike Java, Microsoft technologies like .NET and SharePoint are generally considered (Microsoft) platform-dependent but provide a quick and robust integrated framework. Mobile platforms like iPhone\/iOS, Android and others have fuelled a frenzy of app and mobile site development. \r\n\r\nFinally if you are an enterprise or organization with niche requirements then your vision may extend into the latest research and development of swarm computing (of self organizing autonomous collaborators), cognitive and expert systems (like IBM's Watson's transformation into healthcare), social networking and aggregation, and other cutting-edge platforms.",

An adaptive enterprise client of ours not only strives to stay on top of current research in their industry but also struggles to keep up with the rapid pace of the information technology industry. Although it's not important to adopt the 'latest and the greatest' in all cases, it is indeed important to embrace and be able to absorb the resulting gradual as well as disruptive changes. \r\n\r\nRules of the game are changing with the accelerating pace of scientific and technological research and its subsequent adoption. For an enterprise to survive the resulting turbulence, its people, processes, services, business\/customer intelligence and infrastructure need to be aligned (end-to-end). It is also required to be agile and adaptive, with a reasonably clear vision of what may or may not be coming down the pipe. It can be argued that research-intelligence (ability to understand the implications of current and future research) may be as important as customer-intelligence (adaptive, voluntary or involuntary, customer feedback) to steer through turbulence. \r\n\r\n\"The last twenty years was the story of digitization. The next twenty years would build on it. We will see advances in hardware, materials and artificial intelligence, creating new trillion-dollar industries.

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and swarm Intelligence-based techniques can be used in a number of applications. For example, swarm intelligence has been applied for data mining, and airlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane. \r\n\r\nEnterprises that utilize AI-enhanced applications are expected to become more diverse, as the needs for the ability to analyze data across multiple variables, fraud detection and customer relationship management emerge as key business drivers to gain competitive advantage. With the advent of web-enabled infrastructure and rapid strides made by the AI development community, the application of AI techniques in real-time business applications has picked up substantially in recent years. \r\n\r\nThe ability to be adaptive as well as the ability to forecast change (with reasonable accuracy and timeliness) is critical to survival in this new era of accelerating advances in science and technology.

An adaptive enterprise of today also needs to adapt to the changing media landscape that not only includes venturing into new physical media but also into the evolving social media norms, and we may not want to completely ignore potential social media micro-economies either. In the last few decades a gradual shift has been taking place in virtually every industry where focus has incrementally shifted from physical interaction and working with customer lists, into a world of electronic business, online presence and recently into mobile and social media landscape. Technology, user trends and globalization are among the key drivers for this shift. At this point mobile medium is leading the shift as key players like Facebook, Google and Apple have considerably ramped up their mobile capabilities. \r\n\r\nIn today's world smart phones are in the hands of every consumer and tablet sales have caught up with PCs. Mobile apps are disrupting multi-billion dollar industries including retail, travel, traditional media, gaming, publishing, and photography. \r\n\r\nSocial media continues to move towards greater business integration. In a study by Booz Allen and Buddy Media, 38 percent of CEOs label social as a high priority, and 57 percent of companies plan to increase social media spending. \r\n\r\nCustomer behaviour is continually being transformed by the almost pervasive online access, social-media trends like social sharing, and \"gamification\" of user interface are increasingly inching towards mainstream.

It means having the insight to detect and acknowledge change; it means having the capabilities to respond to change at a moment's notice; and it means having the infrastructure that can support the change without having to throw away everything and starting over. It is a fact that businesses change faster than their information systems. For this reason, infrastructure has to be made adaptive by focusing on platforms, practices and services. \r\n\r\nAdaptive technology means avoiding too much focus on technology. Instead, the focus is on its flexibility for supporting the changing business needs. A practical implication is to cloud-source where feasible. \r\n\r\nAdaptive workforce means creating a collaborative environment rather than relying on individual endeavours.

Technology has indeed presented an opportunity to improve the quality of learning. \r\n\r\nFor an educational institution or jurisdiction, the digital revolution in education is not merely a response strategy for staying relevant in the changing landscape and the onslaught of MOOCs and other competing outlets. It also serves as a brand expansion strategy, an avenue to collaborate with other specialized institutions, co-mingle with external faculty and researchers, share students from other institutions, deliver content more productively and at a lower cost within the ever-tightening education budgets, and to address the job requirements of the IT-driven twenty-first century job market. \r\n\r\nAnalytics to incorporate student behaviour and feedback, technology to accommodate students and staff with special needs, and on-demand content delivery are some of the core initiatives that institutions and districts could deploy. Change is another key ingredient and a necessity; the coursework, course delivery strategies, and their associated information technology should be innately adaptive. \r\n\r\nSome of the technology-assisted strengths and opportunities may include: online content delivery mode, \"gamification\" of education, dynamic coursework, tablets for books, collaboration tools, cost reductions, larger student base, intelligent-learning tools, up-to date and state of the art instruction, students prepared to meet the jobs of the decades ahead, teaching and coursework more in tune with social media habits of the current generation, additional revenue through the blending of various value-added education delivery services, and tiered certification of in-house MOOC-style learning. \r\n\r\nThe various challenges may include: resistance to change (from the existing investments in the existing infrastructure), keeping the brick-and-mortar education valuable, staying competitive and relevant, lack of time and resources to gainfully investigate new technologies, embracing IT-driven practices, MOOC-style learning through virtual and online classrooms, managing change, approving and rolling out the right blend of instruction, effective collaboration tools, video capture and streaming technologies, keeping students involved by meeting their enhanced multimedia expectations, and learner algorithms and analytics. \r\n\r\nAt the end, there is no silver bullet.

Information technology also needs to support the new and open business processes while companies act as their own foundries to spawn these new practices, methodologies and revenue streams. \r\n\r\nSmaller energy players and startups, especially those concerned with new renewable energy technologies and their subsequent adoption, require flexible, low-cost, and cloud-supported IT infrastructure. They need to get the most out of their limited budgets while directing their true focus on developing and funding the idea. However, they need to understand that the right information technology pairing can not only solve problems and boost their operational efficiencies, it can also act as a significant value-added portion of their actual offering. This is especially relevant within the current service-heavy landscape. \r\n\r\nOpportunities in non-energy natural resources are in various new and existing areas that demand agility and out-of-box thinking. Water resources require proper management, in addition to sustainable production of hydroelectricity and other future benefits. The mining industry transitions around new territories, new minerals, demand changes, and the Green mining initiative. Forestry industry requires understanding of new export policies, management of forest pests, biotechnology and various green campaigns. \r\n\r\nThe arctic is undergoing rapid change, presenting not only a great potential, but also a huge responsibility of striking a delicate balance between protection and prosperity, sustainability and development. \r\n\r\nAccording to the US Geological Survey estimate: \"90 billion barrels of oil, 1,669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural liquids may remain undiscovered in the Arctic, with 84 percent laying in offshore areas. Potentially exploitable minerals in the Canadian Arctic include iron ore, base metals, and diamonds. Interest in northern fisheries, tourism, and freshwater may expand as global warming opens up easier access to the region.\" (Source: Canada and the Changing Arctic - Griffiths, Huebert and Lackenbauer)",

You don't want to be left on the wrong side of the next Copernican revolution, whatever it may be for your sector. \r\n\r\nTechnologies and methodologies like big data analytics, randomized experiments, machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization can be employed to glean such insights. Collection strategies, storage technologies, cloud mining opportunities, and non-relational databases (NoSQL) are some of the enablers. \r\n\r\nData can now be gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing mobile devices, aerial sensors, software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks. The capacity of an individual to store information is doubling every three years or so. Each year about three million terabytes of data is created, and our data gathering continues to explode towards the zeta byte range. \r\n\r\nEnterprises that utilize AI-enhanced applications are expected to become more diverse as the needs for the ability to analyze data across multiple variables, fraud detection and customer relationship management emerge as key business drivers to gain competitive advantage. With the advent of web-enabled infrastructure and rapid strides made by the AI development community, the application of the artificial intelligence techniques in real-time business applications has picked up substantially in recent years.

        "text": "Art breathes into the design and implementation functions of a responsive organization. And art bleeds through its interactions, services, and end products.  Your people, regardless of their roles, are your artisans. Your processes bring clarity and optimality to the level of an art form. Your offering welds into the everyday life of its consumer.  Your one service moulds another. Your products run their users, rather than the other way around.  Your science impeccable, your technology responsive, and your business is graceful and agile.  \r\n\r\n Moreover, traditional artistic channels are consistently employed in many stages, including product design, product development, web design, mobile apps, the social media message speech and audio, video on YouTube, informing and training, web ads, just-in-time collaboration, customer-driven development, and innovative means of augmenting the traditional advertising streams. \r\n\r\n Customer behaviour is continually being transformed by the almost pervasive online access and social-media trends like social sharing. Gamification of the user interface is increasingly inching towards mainstream. This significantly affects how a new generation of customers will perceive and react to your offerings,  and hence, how you market to mixed customer segments across current and emerging media and online trends.",

        "text": "Social media continues to move towards greater business integration. In a study by Booz Allen and Buddy Media, 38 percent of CEOs label social as a high priority, and 57 percent of companies plan to increase social media spending. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot that can be said, but here's the bottom line: does it help, or does it hurt? What functions of social integration are really important, and what are just nice to have? Is the time and effort working towards a solid relationship with customers, partners and public? Do the channels truly represent the organization's industry, customer demographics and geography? Will this generate useful analytics, help glean social business intelligence, and measure its customers' true pulse? In short, do you have a social media strategy, and do you have criteria, metrics and key performance indicators to measure if the social media message is relevant, if the time and effort are spent on the right goals, and if the campaigns are contributing towards building company's credibility? \r\n\r\nAn adaptive enterprise can build many such mechanisms into what could be called an adaptive approach to social media integration. The corporation can then use these built-in antennas to sense and tailor its message, optimize the message frequency, and prioritize the most suitable channels (from choices like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, YouTube, and any other suitable blogs). The company would then need to ensure that its campaigns are within its budget and the capabilities of its staff. They should also ensure that the platform itself and the quality of the content (form both sides) represent its corporate culture and identity. \r\n\r\nIt is also important to put a process (including a possible publish and approval process) around the social media efforts and adopt internal guidelines wherever practical. This will ensure efficiencies and message consistency. Automation of redundancies, and artificial intelligence and natural language processing may be considered in the near future, however not at the cost of audience's time and intelligence. \r\n",

        "abstract": "An evolution is occurring in wireless and portable computing: Wireless Internet. \r\n\r\nChallenge: Integrating mobile into business processes and offerings",
        "text": "In recent years mobile medium has taken great strides from its ubiquity to increased productivity. Major players like Facebook have been ramping up their mobile capabilities with acquisitions of Pebbles, Oculus VR, LiveRail, WhatsApp, Instagram, Glancee, and Karma. In the past, advertisers have not pursued mobile media very aggressively. This is changing, especially with monetizing platforms like Facebooks's LiveRail, mentioned above. While the ad-spend numbers often failed to match the anticipated growth, things are changing and that the advertising spending has been expanding. \r\n\r\nSmartphones and tablets have overtaken PCs. In the ever-growing global Internet landscape, mobile is leading the way as the dominant medium. Mobile apps are disrupting multi-billion dollar industries including retail, travel, traditional media, gaming, publishing, and photography. \r\n\r\nAt this point, not having a mobile strategy and a mobile roadmap in place for your brand can be an existential risk to your business or product line. The age of mobile has already dawned, and it will be around for many years. \r\n\r\nIn spite of its continuing maturity, mobility it is still an evolving phenomenon, with may inherent complications and challenges for its adopters. It is difficult to blaze through the thicket of hype and unrealistic expectations. There are also multiple players to contend with, including wireless operators, device manufacturers, infrastructure vendors, software developers, content providers, advertisers, and marketers. \r\n\r\nLike businesses, consumers and end users often don't get exactly what they want. Businesses and providers are increasingly improving their users' experiences, but more ongoing effort is expected from both fronts to make access more seamless and less confusing for their customers. Businesses also need to better integrate mobile into their current business processes. Next-generation cellular systems, public wireless LANs and improved phones and tablets offer to increase the value of mobile for both businesses and their customers. There are further opportunities for businesses for enhancing the user experience and making mobile access more fun for their customers and staff.",
